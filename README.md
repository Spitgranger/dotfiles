### Dotfiles
This repository contains the .dotfile configurations for my current preferred setup.

#### Polybar
- Not much here right now, just a simple addition to the provided default bar with the addition of a battery percentage indicator

#### i3wm
- default terminal is alacritty,
- volume controls are mapped to +/- 5%
- default displays for laptop eDP and Displayport-1
#### tmux
- leader key switched to <ctrl><space>
- plugins installed for vim navigation
